# VirtualSenses
-App in development-

In theory VirtualSenses will have 2 modes:

Seeing, where it will be able to read text from screen useful for:
-Adding live dub to shows and movies using the subtitles.
-Homework, it can read documents out loud, helping users write faster for tasks like homework or other assignments.

Hearing, where it will listen to background audio for speech useful for:
-Overlay live subtitles on the screen based on background audio to help people with hearing problems be part of grup calls discusions.
-Live translation, making the user able to understand people that speak another language in grup calls.

Currently Abandoned/OnHold because I don't have the problem it was meant to solve anymore
